Photo Gallery Application

Our Photo Gallery is a modern, full-stack media management solution built with Bun on the backend and SolidJS on the frontend. It provides users with a seamless experience to store, manage, and view images and videos directly from the server, with fast performance and an intuitive interface.

Key Features:
Media Storage & Streaming
Supports uploading and streaming of images, videos, and Live Photos (similar to iOS), all served efficiently to the frontend via Bunâ€™s high-performance server capabilities.
Advanced Media Search with AI Captioning
Integrated AI-generated captions allow users to search for media using natural language queries, making it easy to locate specific content.
User Access Control
Admins can activate and manage users, ensuring controlled access to media resources across the platform.
Media Tools for Admins
Admins have access to powerful tools for:
Backup and restore of all media and metadata.
Importing media in bulk by specifying server file paths.
Reducing video FPS (frames per second) across the library to optimize storage and playback.
File Type Support
The system supports a wide range of file types including .3GP, .WEBP, .M4V, .JPG, .GIF, .MOV, .MP4, .HEIC, .JPEG, .PNG, including Live Photo formats with paired video and still frames.
Built for scalability, speed, and user experience, this platform is ideal for personal photo libraries, media-heavy applications, or team-based archives that demand fast access and smart organization.
